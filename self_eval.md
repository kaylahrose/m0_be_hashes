# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
###### I struggled with the syntax but was able to complete the assignment referencing
###### the lesson.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
###### Note taking is cumbersome and doesn't *feel* helpful, but I know it *is*
###### helpful. I take the most helpful notes before I start a lesson to keep in
###### mind what the goals are.


- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
###### I usually try to solve something on my own first. If I'm unsuccessful
###### and it is taking too long to solve on my own, I'll go to Google.
